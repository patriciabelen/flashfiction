	<h2>The painting did not turn out the way I expected.</h2>
    <p>But, what exactly did I expect when I appeared in Peter Paul Rubens’ dream to persuade him to paint me? I heard rumors that Rubens was gaining popularity for painting scenes of Christian history. All the artists are doing it now, it’s so hard to choose. I consulted with Jesus and the Virgin, as I always do, and they both praised him. I can see why, his paintings of them are quite dramatic and surely have garnered more followers for our religion. This is probably more important for them than the quality of the artwork.</p>

    <p>I saw Rubens’ painting of Magdalene with her sister Martha and was immediately attracted to it. He didn’t really capture Magdalene’s allure but I suppose that would be impossible without knowing her. Even for me who has known her for many ages now, she is still so mysterious. Yet, the painting is interesting to look at - I just love that shade of red and a jealous Martha lurking in the shadows. Then again, I don’t know anything about Flemish Baroque painting or how to critique it. I should have done more research first.</p>
    <p>Oh, why didn’t Caravaggio get my messages in his dreams? He’s my absolute favorite, able to capture humanity even in the darkest of circumstances. And, the light! So much darkness and lightness, playing off each other, as they should. </p>

		<p>Perhaps, Rubens did not know the details. There is a lot of misinformation circulating about me. I foolishly thought this painting would clear some things up. First of all, I was a child when it happened. A boy of nine with no understanding of how the world worked. Not the adult of Rubens’ painting. Looking at it, one might think I was a strong, muscular adult! Was Rubens afraid to draw a child? Did he not have an appropriately-aged person to pose?</p>

<p>Father told me we were traveling to Amiens to fetch Uncle. I never questioned him. I discovered later that Uncle had been wrongly imprisoned. This happened a lot during Diocletian’s reign. Yes, he brought stability and security to the empire but he could get things terribly wrong too. Father argued and ended up paying the guards off. We weren’t leaving without Uncle. I admired Father’s determination and was happy that Uncle would be coming home with us. I imagined it would be fun to have him around. </p>

		<p>By the time we were ready to leave Amiens, I was so tired and hungry. Father and Uncle left me in the square to buy some snacks. I wasn’t bothering anyone but a group of older children started teasing me, maybe they knew I wasn’t from there. I wanted to get away but didn’t have anywhere to go. No one helped. I had a feeling that this small thing would turn into a big, uncontrollable thing and that’s exactly what happened. Suddenly, there were crowds of people surrounding me. I was terrified. And still no one helped. There was a lot of commotion and I couldn’t understand what people were saying but they were all accusing me of something, screaming at me. I just looked up at their faces, the adults were angry, the children were laughing. At that moment, I wanted so badly to see my father or uncle’s faces. Finally, in my daze, I heard a question, <i><b>Are you a Christian?</b></i> I answered, <i><b>yes</b></i>. I wondered why it was their business. And then I wondered if I should have denied it. But, why lie? There is no reason to lie. “Who are you here with, child?”, they continued. This was my decisive moment. I knew I needed to protect Father and Uncle. If I mentioned them, I didn’t know what would happen. I said nothing. I remember more angry faces and then nothing else.

		<p>I have blocked out the violent act. Any child would have done the same. What happened after, was quite beautiful, enough to negate the violence. I was peaceful, quiet, I felt nothing resembling pain. I picked up my head and spoke but do not know what I said. All the people around me were just waves of color, no details. I didn’t care how shocked or scared they were, I knew they no longer mattered. I was neither shocked nor scared, I felt present and good. </p>

<p>And, here again, Rubens has me wrong. My face looks sickly, dead and pale. My body slouched and defeated. But, I was none of those things! I had never felt more alive. And that feeling continues to this day. If Rubens could only feel what I felt, what I feel, then he would have painted this differently. </p>

		<p>And what of all these gloomy colors? They do not represent what happened. Why are the skies painted gray, as in a doomsday event? Where is nature? Where is the color that enveloped my body, making it more alive than it had ever been? Where is that shade of red? Where are the waves of color I saw instead of people? Speaking of people, who are these two men looking at me like I’m a freak? They are not Father and Uncle. Because if they were, they wouldn’t look so surprised. I saw them both after the event and like myself, they were peaceful, they understood. Dare I say, they might have been proud of me. But, these two men, they hover over me, like they are more important. Is this not MY painting? Rubens has completely missed the mark, made me the victim in my own painting! Where is the feeling, the joy, the knowledge that I have become a saint in this moment? </p>

		<p>Perhaps I have chosen the wrong era. The people of the Netherlands in 1635 are not ready to truly see me. Art has not yet evolved in a way to depict me, or my story. We need new techniques and ways of seeing. I believe this will come eventually, with time. And then, I will think about appearing in another artist’s dream. </p>
